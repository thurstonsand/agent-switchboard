# Changelog

## 0.1.0 — 2026-10-08

### Added

- **The Deck** — `swb` opens a roster of every open pi session, grouped by project, beside the selected session's real, interactive pi, its directory's editor, or a split of both.
- **Persistence** — sessions stay tracked from their first turn through quits, crashes, and reboots until archived. A session whose pi died mid-turn shows as Interrupted, and `w` or Enter wakes it where it left off.
- **Attention** — working, blocked, idle, and Unseen show live in the roster; sessions quiet for 72 hours fold into Inactive.
- **Moves** — pi-wt's `/mv` and `/wt` take the session with them, into the new directory's project, and it wakes there.
- **Scriptable surface** — `swb new`, `open`, `archive`, `unarchive`, `ls --json`, plus `swb drive` and `swb deck state` to drive a Deck exactly as a human does.
- **pi recorder** — `@thurstonsand/pi-agent-switchboard` records lifecycle, activity, and attention to the shared db, and says so in pi's footer when it can't.
- **`swb_archive`** — ask a managed pi to archive itself; it does, and quits once its final message lands.
